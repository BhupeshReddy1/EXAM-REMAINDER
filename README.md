# EXAM-REMAINDER
PROBLEM STATEMENT: This project is used to automatically remind HOD(head of dept)/PRINCIPAL about examinations one week prior to original schedule.
In the last semester, we had fest(technical events) and because of it, notification of exams schedule was delayed. This indeed affects the student preparation/performance in exams. So, this application of mine will help in automatically checking the exam calender of the year and alert HOD/PRINCIPAL 1week before exams so that schedule is made available to all before 1week.
The alert message can be sent using email(ASSUMING INTERNET) or can be sent to their mobile number(Via SMS). 
I am using python anywhere as a cloud service which runs the program daily at our given time.
Main advantage of my project is that it doesnt need a real app since everything can be done using APIs.
